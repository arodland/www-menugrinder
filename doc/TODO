01:41 <hobbs> that sounds smart
01:42 <dhoss> this is one of my pet peeves, having to write a nav menu to
              remember wtf i've written as far as controllers
01:42 <dhoss> so MAYBE i could even put an option in there to somehow get a
              list of controllers/actions and put them into the nav menu
01:42 <dhoss> and have a debug mode to turn them on/of
01:42 <dhoss> *off
01:42 <hobbs> there's no reason there shouldn't be a cat helper that generates
              a model either. The model class is trivial, but people like
              having a helper script :)
01:43 <hobbs> (that's an easy one, I just forgot to do it ;)
01:43 <dhoss> i'm lazy as fuck, and i like to get to coding what i want to code
              and not dilly dally with crap menus
01:46 <hobbs> as far as auto-generating based on the actions, well I'm not sure
              whether the quality would really be worth it, but I guess it
              wouldn't really hurt
01:47 <hobbs> here's an idea that I should probably be writing down for myself
              instead of telling you
01:47 <dhoss> i was thinking more along the lines of a debug type deal, so you
              can click through and shit, then turn them off when you're done
              debugging
01:47 <dhoss> i've got a TODO file open, spill it

01:48 <hobbs> but since the input doesn't really have to be a file, you should
              be able to write a Loader plugin that walks attributes or
              something on the actions in the app, instead of reading an
              external menu file
01:48 <dhoss> that's a fine idea.
01:48 <hobbs> the hard part would be coming up with a nice format for
              decorating the actions
01:48 <dhoss> decorating how?
01:48 <hobbs> what the attributes should look like, to contain the needed info
              without being unwieldy
01:49 <dhoss> sorry, i'm tired, you mean like besides XML in this isntance
              right?
01:49 <hobbs> yeah
01:49 <dhoss> i don't see why a hash wouldn't suffice
01:50 <dhoss> but you're talking about attributes
01:50 <dhoss> i see
01:50 <dhoss> yea that could get unwieldy fast
01:50 <hobbs> I mean sub blargh :Path('/blargh/blarg') :Menu('section="Tools",
              name="Blargh!"')
01:50 <hobbs> or... something. :)
01:50 <dhoss> :-D
01:50 <hobbs> and then you wouldn't actually maintain the menu structure, it
              would be implicit
01:50 <dhoss> huh, that'd be REALLY cool
01:50 <hobbs> it needs thinking, my point is just that there's room to think
              outside the box
01:51 <dhoss> you'd have to deal with it being a root/child node dealy as well
01:51 <hobbs> yeah

uld it take to factor in Forest::Tree to handle the tree stuff
              for you?
01:52 <hobbs> I don't know that one
01:52 <dhoss> hmm, i'll take a look at it :-)
01:52 <dhoss> it's neat, i'll come up with something and you tell me if you
              like it or not
