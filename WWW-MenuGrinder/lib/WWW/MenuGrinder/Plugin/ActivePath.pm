=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<WWW::MenuGrinder::Plugin::ActivePath> is a plugin for C<WWW::MenuGrinder>. You
should not use it directly, but include it in the C<plugins> section of a
C<WWW::MenuGrinder> config.

When loaded, this plugin will visit each item of the menu, comparing any item
with a C<location> attribute to the current URL path. The item that best matches
the current path will have its C<active> key set to "yes", and each of its
ancestors will have its C<active> key set to "child".

=head2 Configuration

=over 4

=item * C<active_child_ref>

Boolean (default: false). If set to a true value, items with C<active>="child"
will also have a key C<active_child>, which is a reference to its child which
is active.

=head2 Required Methods

In order to load this plugin your C<WWW::MenuGrinder> subclass must implement
the method C<path> returning a path name for the current request.

=head2 Other Considerations

It's advisable to load this plugin after any plugins that may remove items from
the menu, to ensure that the chain of active items is unbroken.
